A group contract is a document to help you formalize the expectations you have for your group members and what they can expect of you. It will help you think about what you need from each other to work effectively as a team! You will create and agree on this contract as a team.

 

At a minimum, your group contract must address these questions:

GOALS:
What are our team goals for this project? What do we want to accomplish?
What skills do we want to develop or refine?




EXPECTATIONS:
What do we expect of one another regarding attendance at meetings, participation, frequency of communication, quality of work, etc.?
POLICIES & PROCEDURES:
What rules can we agree on to help us meet our goals and expectations?


CONSEQUENCES:
How will we address non-performance regarding these goals, expectations, policies and procedures?
Each member should "sign" (you can just type out your name) at the bottom of the submission.
